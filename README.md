# merge-gpx-exif
You can record a gpx file on your mobile while taking photos with a non-gps camera. Merge waypoint data into picture exif with this utility. 

There are numerous utilities and techniques for getting gps location data into the exif header of a picture. Mobile phones do this natively. But fancy DSLRs usually do not, I believe because pro photographers want to limit the drain on their batteries and gps tends to use a lot of power. Even so, there are lots of existing utilities to add latitude/longitude to photo exif headers. But I wanted a plausibly useful project to work on, and this is it.

This utility requires Java 8. In the first release I have supplied a minimal Swing-based UI for selecting a directory that contains unmarked photo files, then selecting a gpx file containing waypoint data, and finally selecting a target directory where photo files with gps data are saved.

The gpx file I use is generated by my mobile phone (iPhone) running an app named 'MotinoX-GPS', which records my track as a set of waypoints. While I wander around, I often take pictures with my DSLR. The timestamps of these pictures are matched with a closest (in time) waypoint from the gpx file by this program. The lat/long from the waypoint is then added to the photo exif header and the photo is written to the target directory.

I envision adding a Google map viewer to the UI to browse picture locations after processing.
